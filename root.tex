\begin{abstract}

In the past twenty years the research about exoskeleton made many large steps towards the vision of a durable, natural and user-friendly exoskeleton, assisting humans in many aspects. The idea of increasing human strength or fixing weaknesses of human nature led to great efforts in making these dreams true. In this paper the current "state of art" and their key functionalities will be presented.

\end{abstract}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{INTRODUCTION}

Developing exoskeletons to increase human strength and durability was firstly initiated by the US Department of Defence in the early 60's where General Electric presented the first prototype "Hardiman" which allowed the wearer to lift loads up to 750 lbs. This prototype was far away from what we today consider as an exoskeleton; one arm weighted more than 750 kg, which is thrice more weight than it could lift up.
Modern exoskeletons are designed to be user-friendly, intuitive and safe. The acceptance of the system from the eye of the user should be increased with an high amount of comfortability and agility. 


\section{STATE OF THE ART}

The different systems presented in this paper can be divided into three general types; lower body-, upper body- and full body exoskeletons.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Lower body exoskeletons are mostly designed for the medical sector. Mostly its used for rehabilitation of people who have difficulties with walking (e.g. caused by long-term *Bett gefesselt sein* or by vestibular disorder). Some of these systems even go a step further and try to give disabled people some amount of their mobility back.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Upper body exoskeletons have different application areas; the XOS 2 for example is planned to be used on military operations, whereas other systems aim to be used in the industry. They could be used in the entertainment industry as an addition to a VR-headset to create a even more authentic virtual reality or as an remote hand in the chemical industry to work with unsafe materials.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The last of the three types are the full body exoskeletons, assisting the whole body. They are used mainly to lift up and transport heavy objects; for example the HULC (Human Universal Load Carrier) helps soldiers to carry more supply on the battlefield. Other systems assist people in their daily life or work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Altough the following systems were initially designed for a special purpose, due to continous developement, some cant be fit into just one of the mentioned types. For example the HAL (Hybring Assistive Limb) was firstly developed as lower body exoskeleton but after the second generation it was enhanced with an upper body component resulting in a full body solution. So the divison of the exoskeletons are not strict and the affinity of them might be overlap with other types.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word ÒacknowledgmentÓ in America is without an ÒeÓ after the ÒgÓ. Avoid the stilted expression, ÒOne of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .Ó  Instead, try ÒR. B. G. thanksÓ. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
